## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Per-secret provider configuration: secrets can now specify their own provider(s) with fallback chains
- New `providers` field in secret configuration (list of provider aliases tried in order)
- Provider alias management via `secretspec config provider add/remove/list` commands
- New `providers` map in global config for defining named provider aliases

### Changed
- Secret configuration now supports `providers: [...]` field instead of single provider assignment
- Provider resolution includes per-secret provider overrides before falling back to global defaults
- Validation results now use provider URIs (e.g., "dotenv:.env.production") instead of just provider names for better transparency

## [0.3.4] - 2025-11-09

### Changed
- `Secrets::check()` now returns `Result<ValidatedSecrets>` instead of `Result<()>`, allowing callers to access the validated secrets

## [0.3.2] - 2025-09-10

- Downgraded keyring dependency to 3.6.2
- Updated `with_provider` in derive macro to accept `TryInto<Box<dyn Provider>>` for consistent provider handling

### Fixed

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-17

### Changed
- SDK: Added `set_provider()` and `set_profile()` methods for configuration
- SDK: Removed provider/profile parameters from `set()`, `get()`, `check()`, `validate()`, and `run()` methods
